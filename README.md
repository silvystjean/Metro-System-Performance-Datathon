# Metro System Performance Datathon

### Team Name: Deep Learners

# Overview

This project was developed as part of the Analytics Club Datathon at AU. The objective is to analyze and forecast metro system performance using ridership and infrastructure data. The project provides insights into current trends, forecasts future ridership, and recommends strategies to improve efficiency and growth.

In subsequent phases, macroeconomic indicators are incorporated to evaluate the influence of economic factors on metro systems.

# Problem Statement

Metro systems globally face growing demands and infrastructure challenges. This project addresses the following:

1. Analyzing the ridership trends and identifying key factors affecting metro performance.
2. Forecasting future ridership using predictive models.
3. Optimizing operations with actionable recommendations for increased efficiency.
4. Exploring the impact of macroeconomic factors on metro systems (in the second phase).

# Project Components

### 1. Data Analysis:

- Analyze annual ridership trends.
- Visualize metro system lengths globally and explore trends in system expansion.
- Investigate the relationship between system size and ridership.
- Compare metro adoption across developed and developing countries.
- Highlight the top 10 metro systems by ridership. conditions affect metro system growth and operational decisions.

### 5. Visual Insights:

The above image (screen1.gif) provides a visual representation of the distribution of metro ridership across different systems. This animated visualization helps to illustrate the varying levels of ridership among different metro systems, highlighting the disparity between highly utilized networks and those with lower ridership. Such a visualization can offer valuable insights into the performance and popularity of different metro systems, aiding in the identification of successful models and areas for potential improvement.


### 2. Predictive Modeling:

- Build models to forecast future ridership using historical data.

### 3. Recommendations:

- Provide actionable insights to improve metro performance and increase ridership.

### 4. Optional Economic Analysis:

- Integrate macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP, inflation, unemployment) with the metro dataset.
- Assess how economic conditions affect metro system growth and operational decisions.

# Evaluation Criteria

### Data Visualization Quality:

- Effective use of charts and graphs to present trends and insights.

### Technical Accuracy:

- Predictive model performance and appropriate feature selection.

### Storytelling and Recommendations:

- Strong narrative linking analysis to recommendations, emphasizing creativity and impact.

### Overall Impact:

- Solutions aimed at improving operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and congestion management.

### Presentation:

- Clarity and professionalism in delivering key findings to the judging panel.
