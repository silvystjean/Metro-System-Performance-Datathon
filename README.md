## Metro System Performance Datathon

Team Name: Deep Learners

Overview

This project was developed as part of the Analytics Club Datathon at American University. The objective is to analyze and forecast metro system performance using ridership and infrastructure data. The project provides insights into current trends, forecasts future ridership, and recommends strategies to improve efficiency and growth.

In subsequent phases, macroeconomic indicators are incorporated to evaluate the influence of economic factors on metro systems.

## Problem Statement

Metro systems globally face growing demands and infrastructure challenges. This project addresses the following:

Analyzing the ridership trends and identifying key factors affecting metro performance.
Forecasting future ridership using predictive models.
Optimizing operations with actionable recommendations for increased efficiency.
Exploring the impact of macroeconomic factors on metro systems (in the second phase).
Project Components

## Data Analysis:

Analyze annual ridership trends.
Visualize metro system lengths globally and explore trends in system expansion.
Investigate the relationship between system size and ridership.
Compare metro adoption across developed and developing countries.
Highlight the top 10 metro systems by ridership.
Predictive Modeling:
Build models to forecast future ridership using historical data.
Recommendations:
Provide actionable insights to improve metro performance and increase ridership.
Optional Economic Analysis:
Integrate macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP, inflation, unemployment) with the metro dataset.
Assess how economic conditions affect metro system growth and operational decisions.
Evaluation Criteria

## Data Visualization Quality:

Effective use of charts and graphs to present trends and insights.
Technical Accuracy:
